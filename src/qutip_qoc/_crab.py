This module provides an interface to the CRAB optimization algorithm in qutip-qtrl.
It defines the _CRAB class, which uses a qutip_qtrl.optimizer.Optimizer object
to store the control problem and calculate the fidelity error function and its gradient
with respect to the control parameters, according to the CRAB algorithm.
